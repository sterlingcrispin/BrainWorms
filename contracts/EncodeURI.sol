    I was asked not to publish the full code for the EncodeURI contract
    but I can provide a brief description of its functionality:
  
    It provides a function to encode strings for safe use in URIs.
    
    It keeps alphanumeric characters unchanged while converting other 
    characters to percent-encoded format. 
    
    This process ensures that strings can be safely used in web addresses or 
    similar contexts where certain characters need special handling.
